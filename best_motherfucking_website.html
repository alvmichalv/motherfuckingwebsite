			<h1> <p> This is the <i>best</i> motherfucking website</p> </h1>
			<p> Really it is </p>

			<h2> Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need some styling?</h2>

			<p>You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB <span class=motherfucking>motherfuckingwebsite </span>(.com) is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your fucking default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.</p>

			<div class=wrong2>
				<p> <span class=wrong> WRONG </span>, motherfucker</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2> The best kick-ass website </h2>
			<p> Let me describe the real perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past <span class="wrong2"> motherfuckingwebsites</span>:</p>

			<p> 
				<ul>
					<li> Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed) </li>
					
					<li>The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the   <a href="yahoo.com"> Google home page </a> </li>
					
					<li> Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your damn 16x32 Tamagotchi)</li>
					
					<li> Looks <i>almost</i> the same on every screen</li>
					
					<li> Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem <span class="very_small"> well, kind of </span> </li>
					
					<li>It's <a href=google.com> accessible</a>, so everyone can enjoy it <span class="very_small"> but not everyone can read this - this text is Ant-Accessible </span> </li>

					<li> Shit is even more legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style without looking like an <a href="yahoo.fr"> ARPANET </a> website </li>

					<li> Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use <a href="yahoo.fr">IPoAC </a> </li>

					<li> Uses only free and open resources. Like this ass-breaking font called "Open Sans" <span class=very_small> which btw weighs 15.21kB, wtf </span> </li>

					<li> It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking styles and shits. Nor Angular or any other framework. This website is made with plain HTML, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla! </li>

					<li> Doesn't include any tracking service <span class=very_small"> this website does, but hey, who cares </span> </li>


					<li> Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available <i>JUST  USE IT </i>  </li>

					<li> Use some fucking colors. </li>
					<li> Links don't really need to keep that shitty blue the browser is giving them: nor that violetish color when they are marked as visited. Just give them a <a href=yahoo.fr> nice color </a> </li>

				</ul>
			</p>

			<h2> Well guess what, motherfucker </h2>

				<p> This website is better than the guy and the <a  href=yahoo.fr" id="link_purple"> guy </a> and the guy <a href="yahoo.fr" id="link_purple"> before him </a> </p>

				<p> why ? </p>

				<ul>
					<li> t's over a secure connection - so nobody can spy what we're serving to you (the page might be different for everyone, pshht!) </li>

					<li> It uses one of the most general gTLDs available out there: .website </li>

					<li> It uses the TLD, too: bestmotherfucking.website, check out domainr to do something cool too. </li>

					<li> It uses the kickassing Let's Encrypt CA (don't you see the gorgeous green lock?) </li>

					<li> It runs on nginx: the best fucking web server instead of Apache Server</li>

					<li> It uses a custom version of the awesome ultra-lightweight jQuery <b> /s </b> </li>

					<li> It doesn't use a single media query <span class=very_small> well, not really </span> </li>

					<li> It probably doesn't support all the web browsers, but that's the best thing - if the user's browser is outdated he will notice and maybe he will switch from the crap he uses to a much cooler browser </li>

					<li> It uses some cool technologies like JavaScript <img src="js.svg" width="10px" height="10" alt="javascript logo"> , CSS3 <img src="css3.svg" height="12px" width="12px" alt="css3 logo">  and HTML5 <img src="html5.svg" height="12px" width="" alt="html5 logo">  </li>

					<li> It supports <a href=yahoo.fr> HTTP/2 </a> </li>
					<li> It includes a Cache-Control header, so you don't waste your precious bandwidth if you visit the website more than once</li>
					<li> It uses Piwik, a free and Open Source analytics platform (we still love you Google, don't be mad at us) </li>
					<li> It allows universal access from every website via CORS </li>
					<li> It is Accessible </li>
					<li> It's Open Source, freely available on Github, and everybody can contribute to it.</li>
					<li> It uses the WTFPL - Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License, which is pretty clear on what you can and what you can't do: </li>



				</ul>
